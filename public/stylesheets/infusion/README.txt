    * FLUID-3054 : tiny_mce Inline Edit text editor fails when used with advanced theme.
    * FLUID-2940 : fluid.moduleLayout = fluid.moduleLayout || {}; is in the wrong location in moduleLayout.js
    * FLUID-2935 : fluid.fetchResources method does not call specified function after receiving a 404 error.
    * FLUID-2934 : Requesting a blank page via fluid.fetchResources triggers an infinite http request loop.
    * FLUID-2792 : Saving rich text content, without making changes, will still render the undo control.
    * FLUID-2638 : Invitation style causes Rich Text Inline Edit to misbehave
    * FLUID-1320 : Typing "Click here to edit" is equivalent to erasing all the text

What's in this Release
======================

This release is available in two forms:
    Deployment Bundle - infusion-1.1.1.zip 
    Source Code Bundle - infusion-1.1.1-src.zip

In addition to source code, samples and tests, both bundles include at the top level a single JavaScript file

    InfusionAll.js

that is a combination of all other source files. Developers can include this single file in their
pages to provide all the necessary support for the Infusion component Library. In the Deployment Bundle,
this script is compressed and suitable for production use.

The Deployment Bundle also includes a WAR file suitable for deployment in Java-based containers: 
        fluid-components-1.1.1.war

Source Code
-----------
The organization of the full source code for the Infusion library is as follows:

        components/
             inlineEdit/
             pager/
             progress/
             reorderer/
             tableOfContents/
             uiOptions/
             undo/
             uploader/
        framework/
             core/
             fss/
             renderer/
        lib/
             fastXmlPull/
             jquery/
             json/
             swfobject/
             swfupload/

In the Deployment Bundle, the JavaScript source has been minified: comments and whitespace have
been removed. 

Developers wishing to learn about the Fluid Infusion code, or debug their applications, should use
the Source Code Bundle.

The Fluid Project uses a JIRA website to track bugs: http://issues.fluidproject.org.
Some of the known issues in this release are described here:

FSS:
    FLUID-2504: Flexible columns don't maintain proper alignment under certain conditions
    FLUID-2434: In IE, major font size changes break text positioning within form controls
    FLUID-2397: Opera doesn't seem to repaint certain css changes on the fly, requiring a refresh to see them

Framework:
    FLUID-2577 Renderer performance can be slow on IE 6 and 7 in some contexts.

Inline Edit: 
    FLUID-1600 Pressing the "Tab" key to exit edit mode places focus on the wrong item
    FLUID-2536 Inline Edit test fails using IE 8
  
Uploader: 
    FLUID-2582 Uploader is dependent on ProgressiveEnhancement.js, which is not included in InfusionAll.js
    FLUID-2895 The browse files button displays as a white box in IE 7 when running off the local system in Flash 10
    FLUID-2052 Cannot tab away from the "Browse Files" button with Flash 10; using FF3*

      see http://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/kwZo

Layout Reorderer: 
    FLUID-1540 Can't use keyboard reordering to move a nested reorderer to the right column, using IE6
    FLUID-2171 In IE, can't reorderer portlets containing Google components
    FLUID-858  Portlet Columns load with no padding between them in IE7

Pager:
    FLUID-2880 The Pager will be refactored. Note that as a result of this, there will be significant changes to the Pager API
    FLUID-2329 The self-rendering mode of the Pager is not the default mode
    FLUID-2486 Double clicking or clicking fast on "next/previous" links in pager does not cause advance of 2 pages in IE

Reorderer: 
    FLUID-539 Can't use the "Tab" key to navigate out of reorderable tabs
    FLUID-148 Edge case: visual position of drop target when droppable is at beginning or end of a row
    FLUID-118 Dragging an image offscreen or out of the frame has some unexpected results.

UI Options: 
    FLUID-2398 Minimum font size control changes the text size even when the base size is larger then the minimum.
    FLUID-2481 "Links" selection does not work correctly in UIOptions
    FLUID-2506 Keyboard navigation inside the dialog breaks in simple layout mode: using FF
    FLUID-2524 scrolling the screen while the UI Options dialog is open, will cause it's contents to appear distorted: using IE
